# Google Stock Price Prediction

Stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks which represents ownership claims on businesses. In this project the aim is to build and compare multiple recurrently connected neural network models to forecast stock price values (Open, Close, High, Low) and trade volume.

## Dataset
Google stock records is used to train and test the networks. The dataset includes 1258 workday records from January 2012 to December 2016 to train; and 20 workday records in January 2017 to test.

Let's have a look at the csv files provided. The data is presented as follows: 

| Date     | Open 	| High 	 | Low 	  | Close  | Volume  |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | 
| 1/3/2017 | 778.81 | 789.63 | 775.8  | 786.14 | 1657300 |
| 1/4/2017 | 788.36	| 791.34 | 783.16 | 786.9  | 1073000 | 
| 1/5/2017 | 786.08	| 794.48 | 785.02 | 794.02 | 1335200 | 
| ...	   | ...   	| ...	 | ...	  |...	   |...	     |

Brief explanations for the features:

* **Date** : The day that the stock statistics is recorded.
* **Open** : The price of the first trade, the daily openning price
* **High** : The highest price at which the stock is traded during the course of the day
* **Low** : The lowest price at which the stock is traded during the course of the day
